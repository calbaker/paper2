	abstract = {We utilize the recently developed concept of internal or intraphase mass transfer coefficient to simplify the problem of diffusion and reaction in more than one spatial dimension for a washcoated monolith of arbitrary shape. We determine the dependence of the dimensionless internal mass transfer coefficient {(Shi)} on washcoat and channel geometric shapes, reaction kinetics, catalyst loading and activity profile. It is also reasoned that the concept of intraphase transfer coefficient is more useful and fundamental than the classical effectiveness factor concept. The intraphase transfer coefficient can be combined with the traditional external mass transfer coefficient {(She)} to obtain an overall mass transfer coefficient {(Shapp)} which is an experimentally measurable quantity depending on various geometric and transport properties as well as kinetics. We present examples demonstrating the use of Shapp in obtaining accurate macro-scale low-dimensional models of catalytic reactors by solving the full 3-D convection-diffusion-reaction problem for a washcoated monolith and comparing the solution with that of the simplified model using the internal mass transfer coefficient concept.},

	abstract = {We analyze the coupled convection, diffusion and reaction problem for laminar flow in a washcoated channel of uniform but arbitrary cross-sectional shape with nonuniform washcoat thickness. For the case of an isothermal first-order reaction, we obtain analytical solutions and show that the reactant exit mixing-cup conversion ([chi]m) depends mainly on the transverse Peclet number {(P)} and the effective local Damk{\"o}hler number {([Phi]s2)}, which depends on relative effective diffusivity ([delta]), relative washcoat thickness ([lambda]) and local Damk{\"o}hler number ([phi]s2), and is a weak function of the axial Peclet number Pe and the Schmidt number Sc (or local velocity profile). We generalize the results for nonlinear kinetics and show that the [chi]m versus P curve is universal for all geometric shapes and washcoat profiles, provided P and {[Phi]s2} are defined using the shape normalized length scales {(R[Omega]1} and {R[Omega]2} for the fluid phase and washcoat, respectively) and the normalized reaction time scale presented in this work. Here, {R[Omega]1} is defined as the ratio of flow cross-sectional area to the fluid-washcoat perimeter and {R[Omega]2} is defined as the ratio of washcoat cross-sectional area to the fluid-washcoat perimeter. Furthermore, we show that the [chi]m versus P curve in the kinetic regime {([Phi]s2{\textless}{\textless}1)} is independent of the velocity profile and is given by the asymptotes [chi]m=1 for P{\textless}{\textless}{[Phi]s2} and {[chi]m=[Phi]s2/P} for P{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{[Phi]s2.} In the mass transfer controlled regime {([Phi]s2{\textgreater}{\textgreater}1)}, the conversion ([chi]m), for the case of fully developed flow, is given by the asymptotes [chi]m=1 for P{\textless}{\textless}1 and {[chi]m[approximate]P-2/3} for P{\textgreater}{\textgreater}1, with a transition around a P value of unity. For the practical case of long ducts {(P{\textless}{\textless}1} or {L/R[Omega]1{\textgreater}{\textgreater}1)} we show that the high-conversion branch may be approximated by cm=1-[chi]m=[alpha]1 exp{-{[mu]1/P}} for all cases. We present both analytical and numerical results on the first eigenvalue ([mu]1) and the Fourier weight ([alpha]1) for some cases of practical interest and show that these asymptotic constants are insensitive to the channel geometric shapes and washcoat profile but depend on the numerical values of [phi]s2,[delta] and [lambda]. Finally, we use theoretical results to present criteria for optimal design of catalytic monoliths.},

	abstract = {To investigate the effect of surface roughness on diffusion and reaction in porous [`]amorphous' catalysts, a realistic model of roughness is necessary. By combining small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering, the suggestion from adsorption experiments that the surface is often fractal can be confirmed, since these techniques allow to measure the surface and bulk properties over a wider range of scales, so that the complete scaling regime, if present, can be revealed. The fractal dimension can be determined, as well as the inner and outer cutoff of the fractal scaling regime. No significant fractal surface roughness is found for zeolites, but is shown for such materials as a mesoporous [gamma]-{Al2O3}, catalytic reforming and hydrotreating catalysts. Results from the simulation of aggregation phenomena similar to those occurring during the sol-gel synthesis used in catalyst preparation lead to additional insights. The fractal surface roughness of a catalyst or catalyst support on molecular scales has a significant influence on the conversions and selectivities of chemical reactions, especially when they are limited by Knudsen diffusion. This effect is felt up to the scale of industrial reactors, which implies that changing the fractal surface roughness can improve the performance of an industrial process.},

Part {II} of this two-part paper leverages off the findings in Part I describing the mathematical basis and system modeling approach used in thermoelectric power generation {(TEPG)} investigations for waste heat recovery in light-duty passenger {(LDP)} and heavy-duty {(HD)} vehicles. The {TEPG} system model has been used to: (1) investigate the behavior and interdependence of important thermal and {TEPG} design parameters, and (2) compare potential {TEPG} system power output for a variety of thermal conditions in {LDP} and {HD} vehicles. Integrated system modeling and analyses have been performed for: (1) {LDP} conditions of Texh = {700{\textdegree}C} (973 K) and m?h = 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 kg/sec, and (2) {HD} conditions of Texh = {512{\textdegree}C} (785 K) and m?h = 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 kg/sec. Analysis results, {TEPG} design parameter behavior, thermoelectric {(TE)} material effects, and interdependence of critical {thermal/TE} system design parameters are discussed. Interaction of heat exchanger performance and {TEPG} device performance creates critical system impacts and performance dependencies, which maximize {TEPG} system power outputs and create preferred heat exchanger and {TEPG} performance regimes. Part {II} demonstrates the integrated system analysis approach to heat {exchanger/TEPG} system performance, allowing {NREL} to simultaneously quantify these critical system design effects in {LDP} and {HD} vehicles. {HD} vehicle analysis results also indicate that 5-6 {kW} of electrical energy production is possible using {HD} vehicle exhaust waste heat.},

For the isothermal case, the model may be expressed in the two-mode form as where {\textless}C{\textgreater} and Cm are the spatial average and cup-mixing concentrations, while and tmix,2 are the space time and mixing times, respectively. The first mixing time captures the effect of micro as well as macromixing in the tank, while the second one accounts for the feed distribution (e.g., premixed, unmixed etc.). This two mode model reduces to the classical one-mode model of Bodenstein and Wolgast {[Z.} Phys. Chem. 61 (1908) 422] in the limit of tmix,i--{\textgreater}0. It is argued that for , the two mode model has the same accuracy as the full {CDR} equation while retaining qualitative features for any finite values of .

	abstract = {The {CO} oxidation reaction on Pt-group metals {(Pt}, Rh, and Pd) has been investigated at low ([less-than-or-equals, slant]10-3~Torr) and near atmospheric (1-102~Torr) pressures in a batch reactor under steady-state conditions and at various gaseous reactant compositions using {PM-IRAS} and kinetic measurements. The results indicate that Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics adequately provides a general description of the kinetic trends over a wide range of pressures provided that mass transfer effects are considered. At high pressures, the reaction kinetics fall into three regimes: a {CO-inhibited} low temperature regime where the reaction rate is determined by {CO} desorption; a mass transfer limited regime at high temperatures; and a transient, high-rate regime which lies in between the other two regimes. The data show that the most reactive surface phase, at both low and high pressures, is a {CO-uninhibited} phase. This surface phase is not an oxide phase, but a surface phase that contains primarily chemisorbed atomic oxygen and a low coverage of {CO.}},

Even when {HTEs} can afford {{\textquotedblleft}Edisonian{\textquotedblright}} discovery, how can the increasing amounts of data be converted to knowledge to guide the next search in the vast design space of catalytic materials? To address this question, we recently proposed a catalyst design architecture that uses detailed kinetic models. In this paper, we describe Reaction Modeling Suitea rational, automated, and intelligent environment, based on systems, artificial intelligence, and optimization techniques that aid the development of kinetic models. We demonstrate its utility in developing a kinetic model for propane aromatization on zeolite. We also show the proof-of-concept of how a genetic algorithm-based search strategy can be used to search for kinetic parameters that correspond to an improved catalyst.},

	abstract = {The asymptotic mass-transfer coefficients are determined in washcoated monoliths of various geometric shapes by solving the convection{\textendash}diffusion equation in the fluid phase coupled with the diffusion{\textendash}reaction equation in the washcoat. The dependency of the asymptotic Sherwood number {(Sh$\infty$)} on washcoat properties (relative effective washcoat thickness ?, ratio of diffusivity of reactant in the fluid phase to that in the washcoat ?, and the catalyst loading ?) is examined. It is found that in the kinetic regime (? {\textrightarrow} 0), Sh$\infty$ approaches a new asymptote {(Shw},$\infty$) which depends on the flow as well as washcoat geometries. For ? {\textrightarrow} 0, Shw,$\infty$ approaches Sh corresponding to flow geometry, whereas for ? {\textrightarrow} $\infty$ it approaches Sh of flow geometry. As can be expected, in the mass transfer controlled regime, Sh$\infty$ approaches {ShT},$\infty$ (flow geometry), which is independent of washcoat properties. It is also found that the variation of Sh$\infty$ with catalyst loading is not always monotonic when washcoat distribution around the channel perimeter is nonuniform. Numerical results, describing the variation of Sh$\infty$ with washcoat properties, are presented for some commonly used channel geometries. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers {AIChE} J, 50: 2939{\textendash}2955, 2004},

Storage experiments over a range of exposure (storage) times and feed flow rates (space velocities) show the importance of the {NO} oxidation to {NO2} reaction. At high space velocities, kinetic limitations reduce the {NO} conversion and {NOx} trapping efficiency (fraction of {NOx} trapped). Higher trapping efficiencies are achieved at lower space velocities when the {NO} oxidation approaches the equilibrium conversion limit. The {NOx} trapping efficiency increases with barium loading, but the extent of increase depends on the exposure time. Cycle-averaged {NOx} conversions and N2 selectivities exceeding 80\% are achieved over a range of operating conditions, including cycle time, space velocity, and reductant (propylene) concentration. The {NOx} conversion exhibits a maximum at an intermediate cycle time, and the location and magnitude of the maximum depends on the barium loading. The conversion also achieves a maximum at an intermediate barium loading, indicating that increases in dynamic storage capacity of the catalyst do not guarantee improved reduction performance. The dependence of the trapping efficiency on the exposure (storage) time provides a good estimate for the lean storage time needed to achieve a prescribed cycle-averaged {NOx} conversion during cycling. The dependence of the cycle-averaged {NOx} conversion on barium loading parallels that of the short-time {NOx} storage, indicating the importance of the {NOx} trapping step in the overall monolith catalyst performance.},

The addition of spent air exits increased the convective coefficient and influenced the location of the optimum separation distance.

These devices are becoming increasingly important and fundamental in thermal design across such diverse areas as microelectronic cooling, green or thermal energy conversion, and thermal control and management in space, etc. However, there is no textbook available covering this range of topics. The proposed book may be used as a capstone design course after the fundamental courses such as thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer. The underlying concepts in this book cover the, 1) understanding of thephysical mechanisms of the thermal devices with the essential formulas and detailed derivations, and 2) designing the thermal devices in conjunction with mathematical modeling, graphical optimization, and occasionally computational-fluid-dynamic {(CFD)} simulation. Important design examples are developed using the commercial software, {MathCAD}, which allows the students to easily reach the graphical solutions even with highly detailed processes. In other words, the design concept is embodied through the example problems. The graphical presentation generally provides designers or students with the rich and flexible solutions toward achieving the optimal design.

The "emf" of Kelvin, Bridgman, Ehrenfest, and Rutgers is the gradient of the electrochemical potential and a general formula is given for this gradient in anisotropic media. Both the energy density vector and the electrochemical potential gradient are expressed in terms of a "transport entropy matrix" Sij*. The theory leads in a natural and straightforward way to the postulated expression of Ehrenfest and Rutgers. The formulation is in a form easily adaptable to given experimental boundary conditions and, therefore, brings out the limited validity of the Kelvin symmetry relations, as first pointed out clearly by Kohler. Finally, the theory includes the irreversible effects of heat conduction and Joulean heating, as well as the reversible thermoelectric phenomena and is, therefore, more realistic and complete than the theory of Ehrenfest and Rutgers.},

Moreover, since the epidemiologic data suggest carcinogenicity in humans, and the diesel exhaust exposure data in evaluations in rats by {NIOSH}, {IARC}, {WHO}, and the California {EPA}, are said to demonstrate or support carcinogenicity, agencies have designated them as latent occupational carcinogens {(NIOSH)} or toxic air pollutants {(California} {EPA).} In regard to their non-carcinogenic effects, a contribution to airway inflammation and allergies, and in relation to disease, the possibility of contracting asthma and chronic bronchitis, have been investigated both experimentally and epidemiologically, and concern has increased about their health effects, particularly in children.},

	abstract = {Introduction and Objectives : Recent epidemiological studies have shown an association between increased particulate urban air pollution and adverse health effects on susceptible parts of the population, in particular the elderly with pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Urban particles consist of three modes: ultrafine particles, accumulation mode particles (which together form the fine particle mode) and coarse mode particles. Ultrafine particles (those of \&lt;0.1 ?m diameter) contribute very little to the overall mass, but are very high in number, which in episodic events can reach several hundred thousand/cm 3 in the urban air. The hypothesis that ultrafine particles are causally involved in adverse responses seen in sensitive humans is based on several studies summarized in this brief review. Methods and Results : Studies on rodents demonstrate that ultrafine particles administered to the lung cause a greater inflammatory response than do larger particles, per given mass. Surface properties (surface chemistry) appear to play an important role in ultrafine particle toxicity. Contributing to the effects of ultrafine particles is their very high size-specific deposition when inhaled as singlet ultrafine particles rather than as aggregated particles. It appears also that ultrafine particles, after deposition in the lung, largely escape alveolar macrophage surveillance and gain access to the pulmonary interstitium. Inhaled low doses of carbonaceous ultrafine particles can cause mild pulmonary inflammation in rodents after exposure for 6 h. Old age and a compromised/sensitized respiratory tract in rodents can increase their susceptibility to the inflammatory effects of ultrafine particles significantly, and it appears that the aged organism is at a higher risk of oxidative stress induced lung injury from these particles, compared with the young organism. Results also show that ultrafine particle effects can be significantly enhanced by a gaseous co-pollutant such as ozone. Conclusions : The studies performed so far support the ultrafine particle hypothesis. Additional studies are necessary to evaluate mechanistic pathways of responses.},

Si {\textless}100{\textgreater} substrates that were 20 mm x 76.2 mm were sputter coated with 2 nm to 50 nm gold which formed nanoparticles on the order of 50 nm in diameter through a process of Ostwald ripening upon being heated. Growth temperatures were varied from {800$^{0}$C} to {1000$^{0}$C}, flow rates were varied from 24 sccm to 3300 sccm, and growth durations were varied from 8 minutes to 5 hours. Vapor phase Zn, {CO}, and {CO2}, produced by carbothermal reduction and suspended in an Ar atmosphere, were flowed over the Si substrates. The Au nanoparticles formed an eutectic alloy with Zn, causingthem to become liquid nanodroplets which catalyzed vapor-liquid-solid nanowire growth. The nanowires were also synthesized by self-catalyzing vapor-solid growth in some cases. Using the tube furnace never resulted in more than 50\% of the substrate being covered by nanowires. It was found that a bench-top furnace could achieve nearly 100\% nanowire coverage by placing the 20 mm x 76.2 mm sample face down in a quartz boat less than 2 mm above the sourcepowder. This was because minimizing the distance between the sample and the source powder was critical to achieve macroscopically uniform growth consistently}

Approximate first- and zeroth-order kinetics with respect to the hydrocarbon and oxygen concentrations, respectively, was observed in all cases. Significantly slower rates were seen for methane conversion, but other subtle changes were also identified among the other hydrocarbons as well. The reactivity trends could be clearly correlated with C-H bond strengths, since higher rates were seen for the longer and more branched hydrocarbon chains. Also, platinum was found to be the most active catalyst for the oxidation of all the compounds studied here except methane, which is oxidized faster on the nickel substrate. The variations in activity among the three catalysts were shown to be associated mostly with changes in the pre-exponential factor, not the activation energy, suggesting that they have to do with the surface density of active sites on the surface. The nature of the active catalyst during reaction was determined by simple inspection to be the metallic phase in the cases of Pt and Ni but an oxide layer in the case of Pd.},

Central to this device is a thick nanoparticle film that provides a large surface area for the adsorption of light-harvesting molecules. However, nanoparticle {DSCs} rely on trap-limited diffusion for electron transport, a slow mechanism that can limit device efficiency, especially at longer wavelengths. Here we introduce a version of the dye-sensitized cell in which the traditional nanoparticle film is replaced by a dense array of oriented, crystalline {ZnO} nanowires. The nanowire anode is synthesized by mild aqueous chemistry and features a surface area up to one-fifth as large as a nanoparticle cell. The direct electrical pathways provided by the nanowires ensure the rapid collection of carriers generated throughout the device, and a full Sun efficiency of 1.5\% is demonstrated, limited primarily by the surface area of the nanowire array.},

In this project, a 10.55 {kW} (three ton) absorption chiller was modified for hot gas intake and matched to a 2.8 L V6 internal combustion engine. Mathematical model and experimental test results suggest that the concept is thermodynamically feasible and could significantly enhance system performance depending on part-load of the engine.

	abstract = {Thermal management, in particular, heat recovery and utilisation in internal combustion engines result in improved fuel economy, reduced emissions, fast warm up and optimized cylinder head temperatures. turbo-compounding is a heat recovery technique that has been successfully used in medium and large scale engines. Heat recovery to a secondary fluid and expansion is used in large scale engines, such as in power plants in the form of heat recovery steam generators {(HRSG)} [1]. The present paper presents a thermodynamic analysis of turbo-compounding and heat recovery and utilisation through a fluid power cycle, a technique that is also applicable to medium and small scale engines. In a fluid power cycle, the working fluid is stored in a reservoir and expanded subsequently. The reservoir acts as an energy buffer that improves the overall efficiency, significantly. This paper highlights the relative advantage of exhaust heat secondary power cycles over turbo-compounding with the aid of {MATLAB} based {QSS} Toolbox [2] simulation results. Steam has been selected as the working fluid in this work for its superior heat capacity over organic fluids and gases.},

A heat cycle test was performed in order to analyze the thermo-mechanical performance of modules of three different cross sectional area of elements. Modules of all the three types declined in generated output with the increase of heat cycles. It is considered that the decline of generated output was caused by the increase in the internal electrical resistance of each module. The increase of internal electrical resistance was caused by the poor contact between a thermoelectric element and a Cu electrode due to the deterioration of the solder at the contact with the increase of heat cycles.},

	abstract = {It is well known that the performance of a catalytic monolith is bounded by two limits: the kinetic regime at low temperatures (or before ignition for the case of exothermic reactions) and the external mass transfer controlled regime at sufficiently high temperatures (or after ignition). The washcoat diffusional resistance can also be significant over an intermediate range of temperatures. The transition temperatures at which the controlling regime changes from kinetic to washcoat diffusion to external mass transfer depend on the various geometric properties of the monolith, flow properties, the catalyst loading and washcoat properties. We present analytical criteria for determining these transition temperatures. These are derived using the recently developed low-dimensional model and the concepts of internal and external mass transfer coefficients. The criteria are more general than those in the literature and are useful in analyzing the experimental data. Further, we present an explicit expression for the experimentally measurable dimensionless apparent mass transfer coefficient ( Sh app ) in terms of individual transfer coefficients in each phase. It is shown that Sh app can be lowered by orders of magnitude compared to the theoretical upper bound obtained in the limit of external mass transfer control. Low values of Sh app are obtained due to a small value of effective diffusivity in the washcoat, low catalyst loading or a reaction with low activation energy. The analytical criteria may be used for the design of monolith properties and experimental conditions so that the performance of the monolith approaches the upper limit defined by the external mass transfer controlled limit.},

	abstract = {We examine the classical {Bischoff{\textendash}Aris} pore diffusion problem with a first-order surface reaction and identify three controlling regimes. The first two of these are well known for over 60 years and correspond to the limiting cases of ?s2?1, ?2?1 and ?s2?1, ?2?1, respectively. {(Here}, ?s2 and ?2 are the Thiele moduli based on transverse and longitudinal diffusion times and are defined by {?s2=2ksrp/Dm}, {?2=2ksL2/rpDm}, where rp is the pore radius, L is the pore length, Dm is the molecular diffusivity and ks is the surface rate constant.) In the first limiting case (?s2?1, ?2?1) the concentration gradients are negligible in both the transverse and longitudinal directions, the pore effectiveness factor is close to unity (??1) and the rate constant (kv) based on unit pore volume is related to the surface rate constant by kv?2ks/rp. In the second limiting case (?s2?1,?2?1) the concentration gradients are negligible in the transverse direction but exist in the longitudinal direction, the pore effectiveness factor is given by ??1/? and the observed rate constant (kv) is related to the surface rate constant by {kv?(1/L)2ksDm/rp.} The third limiting regime which we identify in this work corresponds to the limit in which the characteristic reaction time being much smaller compared to both the transverse and longitudinal diffusion times (?s2?1, ?2?1). In this mass transfer controlled regime (which corresponds to a fast surface reaction with both transverse and longitudinal concentration gradients), we show that the pore effectiveness factor is given by the asymptotic formula ???'/?, ?'=(4/?s)[(1/?)ln(2?s2/3?)+0.251] and the observed rate constant is a logarithmic function of the surface rate constant, i.e. {kv?(4Dm/rpL)[(1/?)ln(4ksrp/3?Dm)+0.251].} We also examine various simplified one-dimensional models used in the literature and show that these models do not describe the mass transfer controlled (fast reaction) regime accurately. We derive analytical expressions for the local Sherwood number and propose a one-dimensional two-phase model with position-dependent mass transfer coefficient that has the same qualitative features as the two-dimensional model.},

	annote = {{U.S.} Federal regulations requiring on-board diagnostics ofdiesel particulate filters have created a demand for compact, inexpensive, fast, and accurate sensors for measuring the particulate matter {(PM)} content of diesel exhaust. An electronic sensor capable of measuring the carbonaceous fraction (soot) of {PM} has been developed at The University of Texas at Austin. The behavior and performance of this sensor was characterized in both an older style non-emission controlled diesel engine and a modern heavy-duty diesel certified in 2008 to meet currentfederal emissions standards. The ability of the sensor to detect particulates at the regulated level of 15 mg/bhp-hrdownstream of a leaking particulate filter was demonstrated. Under optimal conditions, the sensor was shown to have a resolution of 0.003 mg/bhp-hr, or 0.005 mg/m{\textthreesuperior}. The sensor operated by measuring the flux of charged particles, ions, and electrons to an electrode immersed inan exhaust gas flow. Two distinct modes of operation were demonstrated. In the first, the sensor detected particles carrying residual charge from the combustion process. In this mode, the sensor was shown to be relatively insensitive to particle morphology and to be sensitive to exhaust gas velocity. In the second, charge carriers (particles, electrons, and ions) were created in the strong electric field produced by a second electrode at high voltage. In this mode, the sensor was found to be relatively insensitive to exhaust gas velocity, but quite sensitive to the orientation of the sensor in the exhaust flow. The size and number density of the particles was found to have a strong influence on the sensor sensitivity: as number density increased with increasing load or decreasing {EGR} rate, so did sensor sensitivity. Thus, as changes in engine operating condition affect particle morphology, the behavior of the sensor changes. A numerical model of the discharge mechanism in the form of an atmospheric pressure glow discharge was implemented to model the charge creation and transport. The model accurately predicted the nanoamp-level electrode currents produced in a real sensor to within a half order of magnitude with no empirical fits. The model tended to over-predict the sensitivity of sensor output to applied voltage but matched the observed sensitivity within an order of magnitude. Due to the lack of modeling flow fieldeffects it predicted a 250\% increase in sensitivity for a gap width reduced by 50\% where a comparison of real sensors showed a decrease in sensitivity of 25\% with a 50\%reduction in gap width}
