For the zinc oxide-containing catalysts, the pretreatment in flowing carbon monoxide at 493 K resulted in a severe decoration of the copper metal particles with {ZnOx} adspecies, whereas after methanol synthesis at 493 K the state of the copper was essentially identical to that seen after hydrogen reduction.

We determine the dependence of the dimensionless internal mass transfer coefficient {(Shi)} on washcoat and channel geometric shapes, reaction kinetics, catalyst loading and activity profile. It is also reasoned that the concept of intraphase transfer coefficient is more useful and fundamental than the classical effectiveness factor concept. The intraphase transfer coefficient can be combined with the traditional external mass transfer coefficient {(She)} to obtain an overall mass transfer coefficient {(Shapp)} which is an experimentally measurable quantity depending on various geometric and transport properties as well as kinetics. We present examples demonstrating the use of Shapp in obtaining accurate macro-scale low-dimensional models of catalytic reactors by solving the full {3-D} convection-diffusion-reaction problem for a washcoated monolith and comparing the solution with that of the simplified model using the internal mass transfer coefficient concept.},

	abstract = {This study provides insight into the effect of Pt dispersion on the overall rate and product distribution during {NOx} storage and reduction. The storage and reduction performance of {Pt/BaO/A2O3} monoliths with varied Pt dispersion (3\%, 8\%, and 50\%) and fixed Pt (2.48~wt.\%) and {BaO} (13.0~wt.\%) loadings is reported. At low temperature ({\textless}200~{{\textdegree}C)}, the differences in storage and reduction activity were the largest between the three catalysts. The amount of {NOx} stored increased with increased dispersion, as did the amount of stored {NOx} that was reduced. These trends are attributed to larger Pt surface area and {Pt-BaO} interfacial perimeter, the latter of which enhances the spillover of surface species between the precious metal and storage components. At high temperature (370~{{\textdegree}C)}, the stored {NOx} was almost completely regenerated for the three catalysts. However, the regeneration of the 3\% dispersion catalyst was much slower, suggesting a rate limitation involving the reverse spillover of stored {NOx} to Pt and/or of adsorbed hydrogen from Pt to {BaO.} The results indicate that the catalyst dispersion and operating conditions may be tuned to achieve the desired ammonia selectivity. For the aerobic regeneration feed, the most (net) {NH3} was generated by the 50\% dispersion catalyst at the lowest temperature (125~{{\textdegree}C)}, by the 3\% dispersion catalyst at the highest temperature (340~{{\textdegree}C)}, and by the 8\% dispersion catalyst at the intermediate temperatures (170-290~{{\textdegree}C).} Similar trends were observed for the net production of {NH3} with an anaerobic regeneration feed. A phenomenological picture is proposed that describes the effects of Pt dispersion consistent with the established spatio-temporal behavior of the lean {NOx} trap.},

	abstract = {Finite time thermodynamics, a subfield of irreversible thermodynamics, is employed to model a cascaded thermoelectric generator, which incorporates all the essential features of a real heat engine. Control volume formulation of a cascaded thermoelectric element was carried out over a small but finite temperature gap to comply with the principles of irreversible thermodynamics. Three important dimensionless parameters are identified to designate poor Thomson effect; low thermal conductivity and low electrical resistivity of a good semiconductor or semimetal. For ideal values of these parameters it has been demonstrated that exactly half of the Joulean heat arrives at both hot and cold junction when temperature maximum passes through the longitudinal center of the thermoelectric element. In general when Thomson heat cannot be neglected, the maximum and the minimum permissible length of any individual module of a cascaded thermoelectric device is predicted involving thermoelectric properties of the materials and passing current. It is observed that maximum permissible length is devoid of dependence on applied temperature gradient whereas the minimum allowable length is not. When half the Joulean heat affects hot end and half the cold side, thermal conductance inventory is allocated equally between the high and low temperature side for best possible device performance. Finally, it has been argued that the choice of constancy of total conductance is not only a natural constraint but also a purely realistic design criterion for heat engines or refrigerators. Such design prescriptions those lead to the prediction of shape and structure in any flowing system is reported in open literature as constructal principle.},

	abstract = {We present a general solution of the diffusion-reaction problem for linear kinetics and an expression for the effectiveness factor ([eta]) in terms of the shape normalized Thiele modulus {([Phi])} for a catalyst particle of arbitrary shape and with an arbitrary activity profile. We also show that the Sherwood number {(Sh[Omega])} or the dimensionless mass transfer coefficient between the interior of a particle or region (denoted by {[Omega])} and its boundary ([not partial {differential][Omega])} is related to the effectiveness factor and Thiele modulus by {[eta]=1/(1+[Phi]2/Sh[Omega]).} Further, the coefficients in the expansion of [eta] in terms of {[Phi]} (the Aris numbers, Ari) are related to the asymptotic Sherwood number {(Sh[Omega][infinity])} obtained in the limit of slow reaction. We show that the curve {Sh[Omega]} versus {[Phi]} is universal for most common particle or channel geometric shapes and for the case of uniform activity is described by the two asymptotes {Sh[Omega]=Sh[Omega][infinity]=1/Ar1} for {[Phi][double} less-than sign]1 and {Sh[Omega][approximate][Phi]} for {[Phi][not} double greater-than sign]1. For two-dimensional ducts we show that the friction factor times Reynolds number {(fRe)} is equal to {8Sh[Omega][infinity]} and provide a physical interpretation of this result. In the second part of this work, we derive low-dimensional models for solving multicomponent nonlinear diffusion-reaction problems using the concept of an internal mass transfer coefficient. We also present low-dimensional models for catalytic reactors using external and internal mass transfer coefficients. Finally, the {Aris/Sherwood} numbers are presented for some commonly used catalyst particles in packed-bed reactors and washcoat shapes in catalytic monoliths.},

	abstract = {We analyze the coupled convection, diffusion and reaction problem for laminar flow in a washcoated channel of uniform but arbitrary cross-sectional shape with nonuniform washcoat thickness. For the case of an isothermal first-order reaction, we obtain analytical solutions and show that the reactant exit mixing-cup conversion ([chi]m) depends mainly on the transverse Peclet number {(P)} and the effective local Damk\"{o}hler number {([Phi]s2)}, which depends on relative effective diffusivity ([delta]), relative washcoat thickness ([lambda]) and local Damk\"{o}hler number ([phi]s2), and is a weak function of the axial Peclet number Pe and the Schmidt number Sc (or local velocity profile). We generalize the results for nonlinear kinetics and show that the [chi]m versus P curve is universal for all geometric shapes and washcoat profiles, provided P and {[Phi]s2} are defined using the shape normalized length scales {(R[Omega]1} and {R[Omega]2} for the fluid phase and washcoat, respectively) and the normalized reaction time scale presented in this work. Here, {R[Omega]1} is defined as the ratio of flow cross-sectional area to the fluid-washcoat perimeter and {R[Omega]2} is defined as the ratio of washcoat cross-sectional area to the fluid-washcoat perimeter. Furthermore, we show that the [chi]m versus P curve in the kinetic regime {([Phi]s2{\textless}{\textless}1)} is independent of the velocity profile and is given by the asymptotes [chi]m=1 for {P{\textless}{\textless}[Phi]s2} and {[chi]m=[Phi]s2/P} for {P{\textgreater}{\textgreater}[Phi]s2.} In the mass transfer controlled regime {([Phi]s2{\textgreater}{\textgreater}1)}, the conversion ([chi]m), for the case of fully developed flow, is given by the asymptotes [chi]m=1 for P{\textless}{\textless}1 and {[chi]m[approximate]P-2/3} for P{\textgreater}{\textgreater}1, with a transition around a P value of unity. For the practical case of long ducts {(P{\textless}{\textless}1} or {L/R[Omega]1{\textgreater}{\textgreater}1)} we show that the high-conversion branch may be approximated by cm=1-[chi]m=[alpha]1 {exp{-[mu]1/P}} for all cases. We present both analytical and numerical results on the first eigenvalue ([mu]1) and the Fourier weight ([alpha]1) for some cases of practical interest and show that these asymptotic constants are insensitive to the channel geometric shapes and washcoat profile but depend on the numerical values of [phi]s2,[delta] and [lambda]. Finally, we use theoretical results to present criteria for optimal design of catalytic monoliths.},

These are derived directly by averaging the governing equations and using the concepts of internal and external mass transfer coefficients. They are expressed in terms of three concentration and two temperature modes and include washcoat diffusional effects without using the concept of the effectiveness factor. The models reduce to the classical two-phase models in the limit of vanishingly thin washcoat. The models are validated by simulating the transient behavior of a three-way converter for various cases and comparing the predictions with detailed solutions. It is shown that these new models are robust and accurate with practically acceptable error, speed up the computations by orders of magnitude, and can be used with confidence for the real time simulation and control of monolithic and other catalytic reactors. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers {AIChE} J, 2009},

The result, applicable to randomly overlapping spheres of either uniform or nonuniform sizes, gives the upper bound for the effective diffusion coefficient as {?D0/[1-{\textonehalf}ln?]}, where D0 is the actual diffusion coefficient in a fluid which fills the void regions of the bed and ? is the void fraction.

	abstract = {To investigate the effect of surface roughness on diffusion and reaction in porous [`]amorphous' catalysts, a realistic model of roughness is necessary. By combining small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering, the suggestion from adsorption experiments that the surface is often fractal can be confirmed, since these techniques allow to measure the surface and bulk properties over a wider range of scales, so that the complete scaling regime, if present, can be revealed. The fractal dimension can be determined, as well as the inner and outer cutoff of the fractal scaling regime. No significant fractal surface roughness is found for zeolites, but is shown for such materials as a mesoporous {[gamma]-Al2O3}, catalytic reforming and hydrotreating catalysts. Results from the simulation of aggregation phenomena similar to those occurring during the sol-gel synthesis used in catalyst preparation lead to additional insights. The fractal surface roughness of a catalyst or catalyst support on molecular scales has a significant influence on the conversions and selectivities of chemical reactions, especially when they are limited by Knudsen diffusion. This effect is felt up to the scale of industrial reactors, which implies that changing the fractal surface roughness can improve the performance of an industrial process.},

	abstract = {{{\textbackslash}textlessp{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessbr/{\textbackslash}textgreaterA} multi-channel model is used to study the impact of flow non-uniformity during cold-start transient operations of a catalytic converter. It is seen that inlet zone recirculation can lead to significant non-uniformity of the flow in the monolith, and this non-uniformity can lead to significant differences in ignition characteristics among the channels. These ignition differences are especially pronounced at lower exhaust temperatures, where the axial location of ignition can vary from one channel to another. It is suggested that this strong effect of temperature on ignition may explain some of the apparently contradictory conclusions about the impact of flow non-uniformities in the literature. The simulations here show that the index of non-uniformity, as defined in many past studies, is an inadequate measure of the full impact on ignition characteristics. For the same index of non-uniformity, the non-uniformity effects on ignition become less significant with increasing exhaust flow rate. This implies that more detailed simulations of flow and temperatures non-uniformities caused by the recirculation zones, heat losses at the boundaries and insufficient mixing upstream of the monolith can be relevant to practical applications.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

A numerical model is used to solve the governing equations. Two configurations are studied: i) the cylinders rotate in the same direction, and ii) consecutive cylinders rotate in opposite directions. The spacing between consecutive cylinders is optimized in each case. The second configuration proved to be the more efficient. In that configuration, it is also possible to optimize further the architecture by using a smaller spacing for the flow passage in which the flow is in the direction of the cylinders rotation, and larger spacing for the flow passage in which the cylinders oppose the main stream.},

These catalysts were characterized by {XRD}, {TEM}, N2-physisorption and laser Raman spectroscopic techniques. The structures obtained by thermolysis of {Mn(II} and {III)} acetylacetonates on {SBA-15} were confirmed by {XRD} and Raman analysis. {TEM} characterization in combination with N2 physisorption studies reveal that nanoparticles partially occupying the pores of {SBA-15.} The nanocrystals of {Mn3O4} and {Mn2O3} on {SBA-15} exhibited tremendous catalytic activities during the steady-state {CO} oxidation at low reaction temperatures (below 523~K). The catalytic activity of these catalysts was found to be higher compared with traditional {MnOx} impregnated on {SBA-15} catalysts.

Part {II} of this two-part paper leverages off the findings in Part I describing the mathematical basis and system modeling approach used in thermoelectric power generation {(TEPG)} investigations for waste heat recovery in light-duty passenger {(LDP)} and heavy-duty {(HD)} vehicles. The {TEPG} system model has been used to: (1) investigate the behavior and interdependence of important thermal and {TEPG} design parameters, and (2) compare potential {TEPG} system power output for a variety of thermal conditions in {LDP} and {HD} vehicles. Integrated system modeling and analyses have been performed for: (1) {LDP} conditions of Texh = {700{\textdegree}C} (973 K) and m?h = 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 kg/sec, and (2) {HD} conditions of Texh = {512{\textdegree}C} (785 K) and m?h = 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 kg/sec. Analysis results, {TEPG} design parameter behavior, thermoelectric {(TE)} material effects, and interdependence of critical {thermal/TE} system design parameters are discussed. Interaction of heat exchanger performance and {TEPG} device performance creates critical system impacts and performance dependencies, which maximize {TEPG} system power outputs and create preferred heat exchanger and {TEPG} performance regimes. Part {II} demonstrates the integrated system analysis approach to heat {exchanger/TEPG} system performance, allowing {NREL} to simultaneously quantify these critical system design effects in {LDP} and {HD} vehicles. {HD} vehicle analysis results also indicate that 5-6 {kW} of electrical energy production is possible using {HD} vehicle exhaust waste heat.},

	abstract = {A novel approach is used to derive a low-dimensional model for a {CSTR} by spatial averaging of the three dimensional convection-diffusion reaction {(CDR)} equations. For the isothermal case, the model may be expressed in the two-mode form as where {{\textless}C{\textgreater}} and Cm are the spatial average and cup-mixing concentrations, while and tmix,2 are the space time and mixing times, respectively. The first mixing time captures the effect of micro as well as macromixing in the tank, while the second one accounts for the feed distribution (e.g., premixed, unmixed etc.). This two mode model reduces to the classical one-mode model of Bodenstein and Wolgast {[Z.} Phys. Chem. 61 (1908) 422] in the limit of tmix,i--{\textgreater}0. It is argued that for , the two mode model has the same accuracy as the full {CDR} equation while retaining qualitative features for any finite values of . The new model is used to illustrate the influence of feed distribution and mixing on conversion for the bimolecular reaction {A+B--{\textgreater}P} and competitive-consecutive reaction between A and B of the type {A+B} --{\textgreater} R and {B+R} --{\textgreater} S. The new model explains experimental results in the literature, including the opposing trends observed for series-parallel reactions under different operating conditions.},

The results indicate that {Langmuir-Hinshelwood} kinetics adequately provides a general description of the kinetic trends over a wide range of pressures provided that mass transfer effects are considered. At high pressures, the reaction kinetics fall into three regimes: a {CO-inhibited} low temperature regime where the reaction rate is determined by {CO} desorption; a mass transfer limited regime at high temperatures; and a transient, high-rate regime which lies in between the other two regimes. The data show that the most reactive surface phase, at both low and high pressures, is a {CO-uninhibited} phase. This surface phase is not an oxide phase, but a surface phase that contains primarily chemisorbed atomic oxygen and a low coverage of {CO.}},

To address this question, we recently proposed a catalyst design architecture that uses detailed kinetic models. In this paper, we describe Reaction Modeling Suitea rational, automated, and intelligent environment, based on systems, artificial intelligence, and optimization techniques that aid the development of kinetic models. We demonstrate its utility in developing a kinetic model for propane aromatization on zeolite. We also show the proof-of-concept of how a genetic algorithm-based search strategy can be used to search for kinetic parameters that correspond to an improved catalyst.},

Direct integration of the appropriate differential equations gives rise to a dispersion vector ?i and a tortuosity vector ?i, both of which must be evaluated experimentally. For the dispersion vector, this is conveniently done by representing ?i in terms of the velocity and gradients of the velocity and concentration. The experimental determination of ?i is not straightforward except for the case of pure diffusion. The analysis yields a result which contains all the features of previously presented dispersion equations without making any assumptions as to the nature of the flow, that is, bypassing, cell mixing, etc., except that it be laminar. Attacking the dispersion problem in terms of the differential diffusion equation provides a rational basis for the correlation of experimental data and illustrates the connection between the microscopic and macroscopic equations.},

	abstract = {{[`]Amorphous'} porous catalysts and catalyst supports have a rough internal surface. Small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering results confirm the original but inconclusive suggestion from adsorption experiments that this surface is often fractal on molecular scales. Not only does this imply that the accessible surface area depends on the size of the molecules moving through the pores, but there also exists an accessibility distribution along the surface. Transport and reaction processes may therefore depend on surface roughness, in a way that can be quantified using fractal geometry.
The effect of fractal surface roughness on Knudsen diffusion is discussed. An analytical expression for the Knudsen diffusivity is derived and the residence time distribution of the molecules is obtained from {Monte-Carlo} simulations. The equations for diffusion and reaction in fractal pores and in porous catalysts with a fractal internal surface are given. Practical examples - vinyl acetate production and the catalytic reforming of naphtha - illustrate the significant influence of fractal roughness on product yields and distributions of industrial processes, from the microscale up to the observable reactor scale. This indicates how conversions and selectivities may be increased by modifying the catalyst surface morphology.},

	abstract = {Advanced, direct thermal energy conversion technologies are receiving increased research attention in order to recover waste thermal energy in advanced vehicles and industrial processes. Advanced thermoelectric {(TE)} systems necessarily require integrated system-level analyses to establish accurate optimum system designs. Past system-level design and analysis has relied on well-defined deterministic input parameters even though many critically important environmental and system design parameters in the above mentioned applications are often randomly variable, sometimes according to complex relationships, rather than discrete, well-known deterministic variables. This work describes new research and development creating techniques and capabilities for probabilistic design and analysis of advanced {TE} power generation systems to quantify the effects of randomly uncertain design inputs in determining more robust optimum {TE} system designs and expected outputs. Selected case studies involving stochastic {TE} .material properties and coupled multi-variable stochasticity in key environmental and design parameters are presented and discussed to demonstrate key impacts from considering stochastic design inputs on the {TE} design optimization process. Critical findings show that: 1) stochastic Gaussian input distributions may produce Gaussian or {non-Gaussian} outcome probability distributions for critical {TE} design parameters, and 2) probabilistic input considerations can create design effects that warrant significant modifications to deterministically-derived optimum {TE} system designs. Magnitudes and directions of these design modifications are quantified for selected {TE} system design analysis cases.},

High speed computer techniques are found necessary. Approximate methods are reviewed and their discussion extended. A number of examples are worked out by both the exact and approximate methods. Comparison of these results show that the approximate methods agree with the exact method to about 5\% in the case of power generation and to about 15\% in the case of the refrigeration coefficient of performance. However, in the case of the maximum heat pumping rate deviations as large as a factor of 2 are found.},

	abstract = {A global kinetic model for {NOx} storage and reduction for the case of anaerobic regeneration with hydrogen is developed, based on parallel experimental studies {[R.D.} Clayton, {M.P.} Harold, V. Balakotaiah, Appl. Catal., B 84 (2008) 616; {R.D.} Clayton, {M.P.} Harold, V. Balakotaiah, {C.Z.} Wan, Appl. Catal., B 90 (2009) 662.]. The existence of two different types of {BaO} storage sites on the catalyst is proposed, which differ in their storage as well as regeneration activity. The two-site model explains the close to complete {NOx} storage at the start of the storage phase and the gradual emergence of {NO} and {NO2} during later storage times. The effluent concentrations and concentration fronts of the reactants and products within the monolith are predicted by the model, providing insight into the mechanisms of regeneration and storage. The H2 front velocities are predicted to increase as the H2 front propagates down the length of the monolith, thus showing the presence of more stored {NOx} in the front of the reactor. The simulations show that even though regeneration is fast, H2 concentration fronts are not very steep, which is attributed to the lower regeneration activity of the "slow" sites. The model captures the formation of {NH3} and the {NH3} concentration fronts, which reveal the reaction of {NH3} formed upstream with the stored {NOx} downstream of the H2 front. The lower diffusivity of {NH3} as compared to H2 is shown to be responsible for the wider width of the {NH3} front and earlier appearance of {NH3} in the effluent than H2.},

	abstract = {It is well known that the performance of a catalytic monolith is bounded by two limits: the kinetic regime at low temperatures (or before ignition for the case of exothermic reactions) and the external mass transfer controlled regime at sufficiently high temperatures (or after ignition). The washcoat diffusional resistance can also be significant over an intermediate range of temperatures. The transition temperatures at which the controlling regime changes from kinetic to washcoat diffusion to external mass transfer depend on the various geometric properties of the monolith, flow properties, the catalyst loading and washcoat properties. We present analytical criteria for determining these transition temperatures. These are derived using the recently developed low-dimensional model and the concepts of internal and external mass transfer coefficients. The criteria are more general than those in the literature and are useful in analyzing the experimental data. Further, we present an explicit expression for the experimentally measurable dimensionless apparent mass transfer coefficient {(Shapp)} in terms of individual transfer coefficients in each phase. It is shown that Shapp can be lowered by orders of magnitude compared to the theoretical upper bound obtained in the limit of external mass transfer control. Low values of Shapp are obtained due to a small value of effective diffusivity in the washcoat, low catalyst loading or a reaction with low activation energy. The analytical criteria may be used for the design of monolith properties and experimental conditions so that the performance of the monolith approaches the upper limit defined by the external mass transfer controlled limit.},

The microkinetic model describes pertinent Pt-catalyzed regeneration chemistry during {NOx} storage and reduction with H2. Kinetic parameters not available from the literatures are estimated to capture the experimental trends and to meet thermodynamic constraints. The kinetic model is incorporated into a short monolith reactor model to simulate the steady-state {NH3/O2}, {NH3/NO} and {NO/NH3/H2} reaction systems. The predicted conversion and product distribution are in excellent qualitative and good quantitative agreement with the experimental data. Among other features, the model predicts for the three reaction systems the non-linear light-off, and the product selectivity dependencies on temperature and feed composition. The model predicted trends in the species surface coverages with operating conditions help to elucidate the selectivity trends. A sensitivity analysis of the rate constants identified the critical steps in the reaction network. The effects of external mass transfer on the conversions and product distributions are assessed and discussed.},

Hence, the electrical power stored in the battery can be maximized. Both analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can work well under different working conditions, and is promising for automotive industry.},

	abstract = {The need for reliable 3-way catalytic converter modeling in the design of demanding exhaust systems for low-emitting vehicles has been widely recognised. Although a number of related models have been presented in the literature, the efficient performance in actual 3-way applications requires further development and validation. The major difficulties posed in such modeling efforts arise from the complexities in the reaction schemes and the respective rate expressions for the multitude of currently used catalytic formulations. This paper presents a two-dimensional catalytic converter model, featuring a number of innovations regarding the catalyst transient behaviour, the reaction kinetics and the solution procedure. The oxygen storage submodel presented is capable of accounting for the redox and temperature dependence of the oxygen availability under transient operation. The redox sensitivity of the reaction scheme gives a clearer insight in the [`]lambda-window' behavior of 3-way catalysts. The application range of the model and the expected accuracy levels in the most common engineering problems are discussed. It is concluded, that although the task of predicting emissions over random driving scenarios is quite demanding in both chemical kinetics and inlet conditions data, most optimization applications may be sufficiently handled with existing kinetic expression information.},

The objective is to maximize the heat transfer rate from the pipe to the cold fluid drawn into the pipe by a fixed pressure drop. Three types of thermal enhancers are considered: (i) porous medium fillings, (ii) internal fins and (iii) insertion of high conductivity solid particles (i.e. solid-liquid mixture). The performance of each thermal enhancer technique is compared with the performance of the empty pipe subject to the same pumping power. The results show that the use of thermal enhancers is not always profitable in terms of increasing the heat transfer rate. The analysis leads to novel limits in which the use of thermal enhancers are recommended so that the heat transfer rate increases for all three types of fillings. It is shown that these limits are related to the properties of the solid enhancer and also to the pressure drop availability. In the case of porous filling, for example, the profitability in terms of heat transfer gain is strongly related to the thermal conductivity of the filling and its permeability.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

	abstract = {The asymptotic mass-transfer coefficients are determined in washcoated monoliths of various geometric shapes by solving the convection{\textendash}diffusion equation in the fluid phase coupled with the diffusion{\textendash}reaction equation in the washcoat. The dependency of the asymptotic Sherwood number {(Sh$\infty$)} on washcoat properties (relative effective washcoat thickness ?, ratio of diffusivity of reactant in the fluid phase to that in the washcoat ?, and the catalyst loading ?) is examined. It is found that in the kinetic regime (? {\textrightarrow} 0), Sh$\infty$ approaches a new asymptote {(Shw},$\infty$) which depends on the flow as well as washcoat geometries. For ? {\textrightarrow} 0, Shw,$\infty$ approaches Sh corresponding to flow geometry, whereas for ? {\textrightarrow} $\infty$ it approaches Sh of flow geometry. As can be expected, in the mass transfer controlled regime, Sh$\infty$ approaches {ShT},$\infty$ (flow geometry), which is independent of washcoat properties. It is also found that the variation of Sh$\infty$ with catalyst loading is not always monotonic when washcoat distribution around the channel perimeter is nonuniform. Numerical results, describing the variation of Sh$\infty$ with washcoat properties, are presented for some commonly used channel geometries. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers {AIChE} J, 50: 2939{\textendash}2955, 2004},

	abstract = {The {NOx} storage and reduction performance of a series of supported {Pt/BaO} washcoated monolith catalysts is investigated {(y\%Pt/x\%BaO/Al2O3;} y=2-2.6\%; x=0-25\%). Storage experiments over a range of exposure (storage) times and feed flow rates (space velocities) show the importance of the {NO} oxidation to {NO2} reaction. At high space velocities, kinetic limitations reduce the {NO} conversion and {NOx} trapping efficiency (fraction of {NOx} trapped). Higher trapping efficiencies are achieved at lower space velocities when the {NO} oxidation approaches the equilibrium conversion limit. The {NOx} trapping efficiency increases with barium loading, but the extent of increase depends on the exposure time. Cycle-averaged {NOx} conversions and N2 selectivities exceeding 80\% are achieved over a range of operating conditions, including cycle time, space velocity, and reductant (propylene) concentration. The {NOx} conversion exhibits a maximum at an intermediate cycle time, and the location and magnitude of the maximum depends on the barium loading. The conversion also achieves a maximum at an intermediate barium loading, indicating that increases in dynamic storage capacity of the catalyst do not guarantee improved reduction performance. The dependence of the trapping efficiency on the exposure (storage) time provides a good estimate for the lean storage time needed to achieve a prescribed cycle-averaged {NOx} conversion during cycling. The dependence of the cycle-averaged {NOx} conversion on barium loading parallels that of the short-time {NOx} storage, indicating the importance of the {NOx} trapping step in the overall monolith catalyst performance.},
